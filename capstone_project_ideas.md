Capstone Project Ideas
======================

P2P Lending Loan Book Analysis
------------------------------
Using P2P lending platform (Lending Club, Funding Circle, Zopa) historical data (loanbook) predict expected return (expected received principal + interest over the lifetime of the loan) for an investment portfolio.

Platforms with high quality (sufficient number of features and loans) loan books:
* Bondora
* Lending Club
* Finbee
* Bitbond (somehow ok)

Bankruptcy Prediction
---------------------
Predict bankruptcy based on company financials (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data)

Also, build a model that allows for estimation of maximum loan size that wouldn't trigger bankruptcy.


Natural Disaster Prediction
---------------------------
Predict (forecast) natural disasters using data from The International Disaster Database and historical weather data.
