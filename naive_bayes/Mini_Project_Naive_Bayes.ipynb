    "# Basic Text Classification with Naive Bayes\n",
    "***\n",
    "In the mini-project, you'll learn the basics of text analysis using a subset of movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database. You'll also use a fundamental technique in Bayesian inference, called Naive Bayes. This mini-project is based on [Lab 10 of Harvard's CS109](https://github.com/cs109/2015lab10) class.  Please free to go to the original lab for additional exercises and solutions."

Each vector has the same length and each entry \"slot\" in the vector contains some kind of data about the words that appear in the document such as presence/absence (1/0), count (an integer) or some other statistic. Each vector has the same length because each document shared the same vocabulary across the full collection of documents -- this collection is called a *corpus*.\n",

This is the probability that we see feature set $f$ given that this document is actually in class $c$. This is called the *likelihood* and comes from the data. One of the major assumptions of the Naive Bayes model is that the features are *conditionally independent* given the class. While the presence of a particular discriminative word may uniquely identify the document as being part of class $c$ and thus violate general feature independence, conditional independence means that the presence of that term is independent of all the other words that appear *within that class*. This is a very important distinction. Recall that if two events are independent, then:\n",

This means that $P(f_i \\vert c) = 0$ for that term, and thus $P(f \\vert c)  = \\prod_i P(f_i | c) = 0$, which doesn't help us at all.

It could actually be considered a stopword. By weighing its counts by 1 divided by its overall frequency, we downweight it. We can then use this TF-IDF weighted features as inputs to any classifier. **TF-IDF is essentially a measure of term importance, and of how discriminative a word is in a corpus.** There are a variety of nuances involved in computing TF-IDF, mainly involving where to add the smoothing term to avoid division by 0, or log of 0 errors. The formula for TF-IDF in `scikit-learn` differs from that of most textbooks: \n",
